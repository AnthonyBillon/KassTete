## Project description
make a game in which you have to connect symbols by passing every cells in java with javafx.
Should be compiled with JDK10
## Todo 
- correct the bugs in the application (you can win, then Ctrl+Z and win again)
- add a scoreboard
- make a valid level generator (the hardest point)
- make this game look less ugly
- make a traduction class with system language management  
I'm too lazy to do that for the moment
